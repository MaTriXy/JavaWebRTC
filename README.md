# JavaWebRTC
An *UNFINISHED,  JUST-FOR-PERUSAL* snippet of code that I used to set up a webrtc between Android devices. I'm using some structures of other people's code that I'm not finding at this stage (I owe you a big thankyou and would gladly give recognition if I can remember where I saw the code!)
